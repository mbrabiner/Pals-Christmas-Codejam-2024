# Pals-Christmas-Codejam-2024
This project is my submission to the Pals Christmas Codejam 2024. To fit with the snowball theme, this game is a two-player Snowball Battle game aimed at children ages 6-10.

## Description
This game is a two-player shooting game. The users must collect snowballs as they randomly appear on the screen and then shoot them at each other. Players gain 5 points when they hit the other user with a snowball. The game lasts for 45 seconds and the user with the highest score wins, the time left is shown at the top of the screen. Player 1 uses the aswd keys to move and the space bar to shoot, player 2 uses the arrow keys to move and return to shoot. They are confined to their own half of the screen and can't move past the halfway point.

### Technologies used
Pygame was used to create the game, and Microsoft Paint was used to create the snowballs and background.

### Features
The game is organized into classes
- Settings
- Characters
- Snowballs
- Snowbullets - fired snowballs
- Screens


### Design
The penguins, music, and font were all free and could be found on the internet.
I made the snowballs and background using Paint.

### Improvements
- If I had more time I would refine the background as it was only meant to be a starting point
- I would also make the screen bigger as this was feedback from my brother
- A lives system could be implemented
- Allow users to mute the sound
- Update game font as its a bit fuzzy
- Occasionally more bullets appear on one side of the screen, might need to implement the snowball timer separately on each side of the screen
- Add sound effects for when a user is hit

## Credits
Thank you to my little brothers Eddie and Albie for helping me test this game and providing helpful feedback. They also helped to choose the background music and decide on a name.
